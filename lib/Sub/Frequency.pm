=head1 NAME

Sub::Frequency - Run code blocks according to a given probability

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Sub::Frequency;

    always {
        # code here will always run
    };

    usually {
        # code here will run 75% of the time
        # 'normally' and 'often' also work
    };

    sometimes {
        # code here will run 50% of the time
        # 'maybe' also works
    };

    rarely {
        # code here will run 25% of the time
        # 'seldom' also works
    };

    never {
        # code here will never run
    };

You can also specify your own probability for the code to run:

    with_probability 0.42 => sub {
        ...
    };

Since version 0.03 you can chain probabilities together:

    normally {

        # code here will run 75% of the time

    } maybe {

        # code here will run 50% of the remaining 25% of the time,
        # ie 12.5% of the total time

    } seldom {

        # code here will run 25% of the remaining 12.5% of the time,
        # ie 3.125% of the total time

    } always {

        # code here will run on the remaining time, ie 9,375% of the time

    };

Note an absence of some semicolons compared with the previous examples.

The function C<with_probability> cannot be chained yet.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a small DSL to deal with an event's frequency,
or likelihood of happening.

Potential aplications include games, pseudo-random events and anything
that may or may not run with a given probability.

=head1 EXPORTS

All functions are exported by default using L<Exporter>.

If you need to rename any of the keywords, consider using
L<Sub::Import> to get L<Sub::Exporter>'s flexibility.


=head2 always

Takes a mandatory subroutine and executes it every time.


=head2 usually

=head2 normally

=head2 often

Takes a mandatory subroutine and executes it with a probability of 75%.


=head2 sometimes

=head2 maybe

Takes a mandatory subroutine and executes it with a probability of 50%.


=head2 rarely

=head2 seldom

Takes a mandatory subroutine and executes it with a probability of 25%.


=head2 never

Takes a mandatory subroutine and does nothing.    


=head2 with_probability

Takes a probability and a subroutine, and executes the subroutine
with the given probability.

The probability may be a real number between 0 and 1, or a
percentage, passed as a string:

    with_probability 0.79 => \&foo;

    with_probability '79%' => \&bar;


Also, for greater flexibility, spaces around the number are trimmed,
and we don't care about leading zeros:

    with_probability .04 => \&baz;

    with_probability ' .4  %  ' => \&something;


And you can, of course, replace the C<< => >> with a C<,>:

    with_probability 20, {
        say "Mutley, do something!"
    };


=head1 TIP: OFTEN (THIS), ELSE (THAT)

Just chain your probability call with an always() call:

    sometimes {
        ...
    } always {
        ...
    };

In chained mode, the next function will be called when the first
isn't (meaning "1 - p" of the times). Adding an C<always()> call
as that next function will make the remainder part always be
called, working like an "else" for your probability block..


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

I<< "$foo does not look like a number or a percentage." >>

B<Hint:> Are you using something other than '.' as your floating point
separator?

This coercion error may occur when you try passing a scalar to
with_probability() with something that doesn't look like a number
or a percentage. Like:

    with_probability 'monkey', { say 'some code' };

In the code above, you should replace 'monkey' with a number
between 0 and 1, or a percentage string (such as '15%').
